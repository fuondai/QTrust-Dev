## Key Components

### 1. Adaptive Proof of Stake (PoS)

The Adaptive PoS system (contained in `qtrust/consensus/adaptive_pos.py`) is a core component that manages validators and optimizes energy consumption through intelligent validator rotation.

**Key features:**
- Smart energy management for validators using a `ValidatorStakeInfo` class to track and manage validator energy states
- Performance-based validator selection that considers trust scores and stake
- Adaptive rotation of validators to optimize energy usage based on validator performance and energy state
- Multiple energy optimization levels (low, balanced, aggressive) with configurable weights
- Energy prediction and efficiency rankings for improved validator management

**Test results:**
- `TestValidatorStakeInfo` verifies the proper functioning of validator energy management and performance tracking
- `TestAdaptivePoSManager` confirms the effective rotation of validators based on energy levels
- Integration tests show significant energy savings through validator rotation

### 2. Adaptive Consensus

The Adaptive Consensus module (in `qtrust/consensus/adaptive_consensus.py`) provides a flexible consensus system that selects the most appropriate protocol based on transaction characteristics and network conditions.

**Supported protocols:**
- **FastBFT**: Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance for low-value transactions (low latency: 0.2, low energy: 0.3, moderate security: 0.7)
- **PBFT**: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance for standard transactions (balanced latency: 0.5, energy: 0.6, security: 0.85)
- **RobustBFT**: High-security consensus for high-value transactions (high security: 0.95, higher latency: 0.8 and energy: 0.8)
- **LightBFT**: Energy-efficient consensus for trusted environments (very low energy: 0.2, latency: 0.15, moderate security: 0.75)

**Adaptive factors:**
- Transaction value: Higher values trigger more secure protocols
- Network congestion: Higher congestion may lead to more efficient protocols
- Trust scores: High trust enables more lightweight protocols
- Protocol selection uses a weighted scoring mechanism based on these factors

**Test results:**
- `TestAdaptiveConsensusWithPoS` confirms proper integration between Adaptive Consensus and Adaptive PoS
- System integration tests show the system successfully selecting appropriate consensus protocols for different transaction types

### 3. MAD-RAPID Router

The Multi-Agent Dynamic Routing and Adaptive Path Intelligence Distribution (MAD-RAPID) Router (in `qtrust/routing/mad_rapid.py`) provides intelligent cross-shard transaction routing.

**Key capabilities:**
- Proximity-aware routing with geographical/logical coordinates
- Dynamic mesh connections that adapt to traffic patterns
- Predictive routing based on historical traffic patterns
- Zone-based optimization for improved geographical locality
- Adaptive path finding with congestion avoidance
- Priority-based routing for different transaction types (normal, low_latency, high_security, energy_efficient)
- Path caching with expiration for improved performance

**Test results:**
- Routing tests demonstrate efficient path selection with an average hop count of 1.0
- Route optimization tests confirm the router's ability to adapt to changing congestion levels
- Performance analysis shows the router effectively balances congestion, latency, energy, and trust factors

### 4. Federated Learning

The Federated Learning system (in `qtrust/federated/federated_learning.py`) enables distributed learning across nodes without sharing raw data.

**Features:**
- `FederatedModel`, `FederatedClient`, and `FederatedLearning` classes for managing the federated learning process
- Model aggregation with multiple methods (FedAvg, FedTrust, FedAdam)
- Privacy-preserving learning with differential privacy mechanisms
- Secure aggregation for enhanced protection
- Personalized models for each node with adaptable weights through parameterized model mixing
- Trust-based client selection for improved model quality
- Byzantine-resistant aggregation to prevent attacks

### 5. Trust Models

The Trust evaluation models (in `qtrust/trust/models.py`) assess the reliability of nodes in the blockchain network.

**Key components:**
- `QNetwork`: Deep Q-Network with optional Dueling Network architecture
- `ActorCriticNetwork`: Network for Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C/A3C) learning methods
- `TrustNetwork`: Neural network for evaluating trustworthiness of nodes
- Hierarchical Trust-based Dynamic Consensus Mechanism (HTDCM) in `qtrust/trust/htdcm.py`
- Anomaly detection for identifying malicious nodes in `qtrust/trust/anomaly_detection.py`

### 6. DQN Agents

The Deep Q-Network agents (in `qtrust/agents/dqn/`) optimize decision-making processes in the blockchain system.

**Implementations:**
- Vanilla DQN with core implementation in `agent.py`
- Double DQN with Prioritized Experience Replay
- Dueling DQN for improved state value estimation
- Noisy DQN for better exploration
- Rainbow DQN (in `rainbow_agent.py`) combining multiple DQN improvements
