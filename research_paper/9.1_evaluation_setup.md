# Experimental Evaluation and Analysis

## 9.1 Experimental Setup

To rigorously evaluate QTrust's performance, security, and scalability properties, we designed an extensive experimental framework that simulates realistic blockchain network conditions. Our experimental setup encompasses both controlled environments and large-scale simulations to provide comprehensive insights into the system's behavior under various conditions.

### 9.1.1 Hardware Configuration

All experiments were conducted using the following hardware:
- Computation nodes: 64 AWS EC2 c5.4xlarge instances (16 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM each)
- Storage: 256 GB NVMe SSD per node
- Network: 10 Gbps dedicated network connections with configurable network conditions
- GPU acceleration: NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs for DRL training (8 dedicated instances)

### 9.1.2 Network Simulation

We employed a custom network simulator that models realistic blockchain network conditions, including:
- Variable latency (20-500ms) based on geographical distribution
- Bandwidth constraints (10-1000 Mbps)
- Packet loss (0-5%)
- Network partitioning events
- Byzantine behavior (0-33% of nodes)

The network topology was modeled after real-world internet connectivity patterns, with nodes distributed across simulated geographic regions to reflect realistic deployment scenarios.

### 9.1.3 Workload Generation

Transaction workloads were generated using three distinct patterns:
1. **Uniform Random**: Transactions generated with uniform distribution across all shards
2. **Skewed Distribution**: 80% of transactions targeting 20% of shards (Pareto principle)
3. **Temporal Patterns**: Workload intensity varying according to time-of-day patterns observed in real blockchain networks

For each pattern, we varied the transaction rate from 1,000 to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) to evaluate system performance under different loads.

### 9.1.4 System Configuration

QTrust was configured with the following parameters:
- Number of shards: varied from 4 to 64
- Nodes per shard: varied from 10 to 100
- Consensus protocols available: PoW, PoS, PBFT, and HotStuff
- Transaction complexity: simple transfers, smart contract execution, and complex cross-shard transactions
- Initial DRL models: pre-trained on 1 million simulated transactions
- Federated learning rounds: every 1,000 blocks

We compared QTrust against implementations of three leading sharding approaches:
1. **Ethereum 2.0** (Beacon Chain and shard design)
2. **Polkadot** (Relay Chain and parachain architecture)
3. **Harmony** (Effective Proof-of-Stake with sharding)

These were implemented following their official specifications and optimized for fair comparison.

## 9.2 Evaluation Metrics
