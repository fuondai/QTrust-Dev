# Abstract

Blockchain scalability remains a critical challenge despite numerous technical advances in the field. In this paper, we present QTrust, a novel blockchain framework that addresses the trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization through an intelligent sharding approach powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Federated Learning. Unlike conventional sharding techniques that rely on predetermined configurations, QTrust employs a Rainbow DQN architecture to dynamically optimize transaction routing and shard composition in response to network conditions. Our system introduces several key innovations: (1) a Hierarchical Trust-based Data Center Mechanism (HTDCM) for multi-level node trust evaluation, (2) an adaptive consensus protocol selection mechanism that dynamically chooses optimal consensus approaches based on transaction characteristics, and (3) the Multi-Agent Dynamic Routing and Adaptive Path Intelligence Distribution (MAD-RAPID) system for efficient cross-shard transactions. Experimental results demonstrate that QTrust achieves 39% higher throughput (1,240 transactions per second) compared to leading sharding-based blockchain systems while reducing latency by 42% (1.2 seconds) and energy consumption by 15%. Notably, our federated learning approach maintains these performance improvements while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead by 56%. Under simulated attack scenarios, QTrust demonstrated 92% attack resilience, significantly outperforming existing solutions. These results highlight the potential of combining advanced machine learning techniques with blockchain technology to address fundamental challenges in distributed ledger systems.
