<!-- PROMPT FOR AI RESEARCH PAPER WRITER -->
<!--
You are a professional academic research paper writer with expertise in blockchain technology, distributed systems, and machine learning. Your task is to write the Evaluation section for a scientific paper about QTrust - an advanced blockchain sharding framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Federated Learning for enhanced performance.

Use the following guidelines:
1. Write in a formal, academic style suitable for top-tier journals
2. Structure the section with the following subsections:
   - Experimental Setup
   - Evaluation Metrics
   - Performance Evaluation
   - Scalability Analysis
   - Security Analysis
   - Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art
   - Ablation Studies
   - Discussion of Results
3. Include detailed descriptions of experimental parameters and configurations
4. Provide comprehensive results including throughput, latency, security indicators, and energy efficiency
5. Include tables and references to figures that would illustrate the performance of QTrust
6. Discuss both strengths and limitations revealed by the evaluation
7. Analyze the significance of the results in the context of existing blockchain systems

The Evaluation section should provide clear evidence of QTrust's performance advantages while maintaining scientific rigor. Include appropriate comparisons with leading sharding solutions like Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, and Harmony. Make sure to thoroughly evaluate all innovative components: Rainbow DQN, HTDCM, MAD-RAPID, and Federated Learning.
