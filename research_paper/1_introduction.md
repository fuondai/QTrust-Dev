# Introduction

Blockchain technology has revolutionized distributed computing by enabling trustless, transparent, and immutable record-keeping across decentralized networks. Since the introduction of Bitcoin by Nakamoto [1], blockchain systems have evolved from simple cryptocurrency ledgers to complex platforms supporting smart contracts, decentralized applications, and various forms of digital assets [2,3]. Despite this remarkable progress, the fundamental challenge of scaling blockchain networks while maintaining security and decentralization—commonly known as the "blockchain trilemma"—persists as a significant obstacle to widespread adoption [4,5].

Current blockchain systems face severe limitations in processing capacity, with popular platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum processing only 7 and 15 transactions per second (TPS) respectively [6]. This stands in stark contrast to traditional payment systems such as Visa, which routinely handles over 24,000 TPS [7]. The performance gap becomes even more pronounced when considering the growing demands of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enterprise blockchain applications, all of which require high throughput and low latency [8,9].

## The Blockchain Scalability Challenge

The scalability challenge stems from the inherent design of blockchain systems, where every node must process and store all transactions to maintain the network's security and decentralization [10]. Various approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, including layer-2 solutions [11], directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) [12], and most notably, sharding [13,14]. Sharding, inspired by traditional database partitioning techniques, divides the blockchain network into smaller, manageable subnetworks (shards) that process transactions in parallel [15].

While sharding has shown promise in platforms like Ethereum 2.0 [16], Polkadot [17], and Harmony [18], existing implementations rely on static or semi-dynamic configurations that fail to adapt effectively to fluctuating network conditions, varying transaction patterns, and evolving security threats [19]. Furthermore, cross-shard transactions remain a significant bottleneck, often requiring complex coordination protocols that increase latency and vulnerability to attacks [20,21].

Another critical limitation of current sharding approaches is their reliance on predefined trust mechanisms that fail to account for the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of node behavior in decentralized networks [22]. Trust in these systems is typically binary or simplistically quantified, which proves insufficient in complex, adversarial environments where sophisticated attack vectors such as Sybil attacks, eclipse attacks, and cross-shard security exploits are increasingly common [23,24].

## The Need for Adaptive Intelligence in Blockchain Sharding

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in the domains of reinforcement learning and federated learning, offer promising new approaches to address the limitations of current sharding systems [25,26]. Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems in dynamic environments, from game playing to resource allocation [27,28]. Meanwhile, federated learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed networks while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead [29,30].

Despite the potential synergies between these AI techniques and blockchain sharding, existing research has largely explored them in isolation. Several studies have applied reinforcement learning to optimize blockchain parameters [31,32] or federated learning for consensus mechanisms [33], but a comprehensive framework that integrates these technologies to address the full spectrum of sharding challenges remains absent from the literature.

## Our Approach: QTrust

In this paper, we present QTrust, a novel blockchain framework that addresses the blockchain trilemma through an intelligent sharding approach powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Federated Learning. QTrust represents a paradigm shift in blockchain sharding by replacing static, predetermined configurations with dynamic, adaptive mechanisms that continuously optimize for security, performance, and decentralization based on real-time network conditions.

At the core of QTrust is a Rainbow DQN architecture [34] that learns optimal transaction routing and shard composition strategies through interaction with a simulated blockchain environment. Unlike conventional sharding approaches, QTrust's reinforcement learning agents make decisions based on a comprehensive state representation that includes network congestion, transaction values, node trust scores, and historical performance metrics. This enables the system to adapt seamlessly to changing conditions and evolving attack patterns.

QTrust introduces several key innovations that collectively address the limitations of existing sharding systems:

1. **Hierarchical Trust-based Data Center Mechanism (HTDCM)**: A multi-level trust evaluation framework that combines transaction history, response times, peer ratings, and machine learning-based anomaly detection to maintain accurate and nuanced trust scores for all nodes in the network. This goes beyond simple reputation systems by incorporating temporal patterns, behavioral analysis, and cross-validation to detect sophisticated attacks.

2. **Adaptive Consensus Protocol Selection**: A dynamic mechanism that selects the optimal consensus protocol (FastBFT, PBFT, RobustBFT, or LightBFT) for each transaction based on its value, the current network conditions, and the trust profile of participating nodes. This adaptive approach ensures an optimal balance between security and performance for every transaction.

3. **Multi-Agent Dynamic Routing and Adaptive Path Intelligence Distribution (MAD-RAPID)**: A sophisticated cross-shard transaction routing system that leverages geographical proximity, congestion prediction, and dynamic mesh connections to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Unlike traditional routing algorithms, MAD-RAPID continuously learns from transaction patterns to predict and avoid congestion before it occurs.

4. **Federated Learning for Distributed Model Training**: A privacy-preserving approach to training and updating the system's machine learning models across the decentralized network without sharing sensitive node data. This enables QTrust to benefit from collective intelligence while maintaining the privacy and sovereignty of individual nodes.

## Contributions
