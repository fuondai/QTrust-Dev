# Federated Learning System for Privacy-Preserving Distributed Intelligence

## 8.1 Challenges of Distributed Machine Learning in Blockchain

Machine learning in blockchain systems presents unique challenges that traditional centralized approaches cannot adequately address. This is particularly true in sharded blockchain environments, where data and computation are distributed across multiple partitions. This section introduces QTrust's Federated Learning System, which enables privacy-preserving distributed model training while maintaining high model quality and system performance.

Traditional approaches to machine learning in blockchain environments typically follow two paradigms, both with significant limitations:

1. **Centralized Learning**: Transaction data is collected from nodes and aggregated in a central location for model training. This approach compromises privacy, introduces single points of failure, and contradicts the decentralized ethos of blockchain systems [110].

2. **Local Independent Learning**: Each node or shard trains its own models independently, resulting in suboptimal performance due to limited data access and model divergence [111].

These limitations are exacerbated in QTrust's context, where machine learning models play critical roles in transaction routing, consensus selection, and trust evaluation. The system requires high-quality models that can adapt to changing conditions while respecting the privacy and autonomy of individual nodes. Specific challenges include:

1. **Data Privacy and Sovereignty**: Transaction data in blockchain systems contains sensitive information that nodes may be unwilling or legally unable to share.

2. **Non-IID Data Distribution**: Transaction patterns vary significantly across shards, resulting in non-identically distributed data that can cause model bias and reduced generalization.

3. **Communication Overhead**: Blockchain networks often have limited bandwidth, making traditional distributed learning approaches impractical.

4. **Dynamic Participation**: Nodes may join, leave, or become temporarily unavailable, requiring learning mechanisms that can accommodate changing participation.

5. **Security Concerns**: Malicious participants may attempt to poison the learning process through adversarial inputs or model manipulation.

Existing federated learning approaches in blockchain contexts, such as those proposed by Kim et al. [73] and Lu et al. [76], address some of these challenges but typically focus on using blockchain as a platform for federated learning rather than applying federated learning to optimize blockchain performance. QTrust's Federated Learning System takes a novel approach by integrating federated learning as a core component of the blockchain infrastructure, enabling continuous improvement of system intelligence while maintaining privacy and security.

## 8.2 Federated Learning Architecture in QTrust

The Federated Learning System in QTrust is designed as a multi-level architecture that enables coordinated learning across the network while respecting the privacy and autonomy of individual nodes. The architecture consists of five primary components, as illustrated in Figure 13:

1. **Local Model Trainers (LMT)**: Operate on individual nodes, training models on local transaction data without sharing the raw data.
2. **Shard Aggregation Servers (SAS)**: Coordinate model aggregation within each shard, combining node-level models into shard-level models.
3. **Global Model Coordinator (GMC)**: Manages cross-shard model aggregation, and distributes the global model.
4. **Differential Privacy Engine (DPE)**: Applies privacy-preserving techniques to model updates to prevent information leakage.
5. **Model Quality Monitor (MQM)**: Evaluates model performance and detects issues such as model drift or poisoning attempts.

These components work together to implement a hierarchical federated learning approach that balances model quality, privacy, and communication efficiency. The process operates in rounds, with each round consisting of local training, shard-level aggregation, global aggregation, and model distribution.

Formally, we define the Federated Learning System as:

$FLS = (LMT, SAS, GMC, DPE, MQM)$

Where:
- $LMT: D_{local} \times M_{global} \rightarrow M_{local}$ maps local data and the global model to updated local models
- $SAS: \{M_{local}^1, M_{local}^2, ..., M_{local}^n\} \rightarrow M_{shard}$ aggregates local models into a shard model
- $GMC: \{M_{shard}^1, M_{shard}^2, ..., M_{shard}^m\} \rightarrow M_{global}$ aggregates shard models into a global model
- $DPE: M \rightarrow M'$ applies differential privacy mechanisms to models
- $MQM: M \times P \rightarrow Q$ evaluates model quality based on performance metrics

The system supports multiple model types, including:
- $M_{DRL}$: Rainbow DQN models for transaction routing and shard optimization
- $M_{trust}$: Anomaly detection models for the HTDCM
- $M_{congestion}$: Congestion prediction models for MAD-RAPID

Each model type follows the same federated learning process but with type-specific hyperparameters and evaluation metrics.

## 8.3 Privacy-Preserving Model Aggregation

A key innovation in QTrust's Federated Learning System is its multi-level aggregation approach that preserves privacy while minimizing communication overhead and maximizing model quality.

### 8.3.1 Local Model Training

On each node, local models are trained using only the node's transaction data:

$M_{local}^{t+1,i} = M_{local}^{t,i} - \eta \nabla L(M_{global}^t, D_i)$

Where:
- $M_{local}^{t,i}$ is the local model of node $i$ at round $t$
- $M_{global}^t$ is the global model at round $t$
- $\eta$ is the learning rate
- $\nabla L$ is the gradient of the loss function
- $D_i$ is the local dataset of node $i$

Local training starts from the current global model, focusing on fine-tuning rather than training from scratch. This approach, known as FedProx [112], helps mitigate model divergence:

$\min_{M_{local}} L(M_{local}, D_i) + \frac{\mu}{2} ||M_{local} - M_{global}^t||^2$

Where $\mu$ is a regularization parameter that controls proximity to the global model.

### 8.3.2 Model Update Compression

To reduce communication overhead, model updates are compressed before transmission:

$\Delta M_{local}^{t,i} = M_{local}^{t+1,i} - M_{global}^t$

The compression function reduces the size of the update while preserving its essential information:

$\Delta \hat{M}_{local}^{t,i} = Compress(\Delta M_{local}^{t,i})$

We implement three complementary compression techniques:

1. **Quantization**: Reducing the precision of model parameters from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integers:
   
   $Quantize(x) = round\left(\frac{x - min(x)}{max(x) - min(x)} \cdot (2^b - 1)\right)$
   
   Where $b$ is the bit depth (typically 8).

2. **Sparsification**: Transmitting only the top-k elements with the largest magnitude:
   
   $Sparsify(x, k) = TopK(x, k)$
   
   Where $k$ is typically set to transmit only 10% of the parameters.

3. **Low-Rank Approximation**: For weight matrices, using singular value decomposition (SVD) to represent the matrix with lower dimensionality:
   
   $W \approx U\Sigma V^T$
   
   Where only the top $r$ singular values and their corresponding vectors are transmitted.

These techniques collectively reduce communication volume by up to 95% while maintaining model quality.

### 8.3.3 Shard-Level Aggregation

Within each shard, the Shard Aggregation Server combines local model updates to create a shard-level model:

$M_{shard}^{t+1,j} = M_{global}^t + \frac{\sum_{i \in N_j} w_i \cdot \Delta M_{local}^{t,i}}{\sum_{i \in N_j} w_i}$

Where:
- $M_{shard}^{t+1,j}$ is the shard model for shard $j$ at round $t+1$
- $N_j$ is the set of nodes in shard $j$
- $w_i$ is the weight assigned to node $i$

The weight $w_i$ is determined by a combination of factors:

$w_i = |D_i| \cdot TrustScore(i) \cdot ParticipationFactor(i)$

Where:
- $|D_i|$ is the size of the local dataset
- $TrustScore(i)$ is the node's trust score from the HTDCM
- $ParticipationFactor(i)$ reflects the node's consistency in participation

This weighted aggregation approach ensures that nodes with more data, higher trust, and more consistent participation have greater influence on the shard model.

### 8.3.4 Global Model Aggregation

The Global Model Coordinator aggregates shard-level models to create the global model:

$M_{global}^{t+1} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^m v_j \cdot M_{shard}^{t+1,j}}{\sum_{j=1}^m v_j}$

Where:
- $m$ is the number of shards
- $v_j$ is the weight assigned to shard $j$

The shard weight $v_j$ is determined by:

$v_j = |N_j| \cdot \sum_{i \in N_j} |D_i| \cdot AvgTrustScore(j)$

Where $AvgTrustScore(j)$ is the average trust score of nodes in shard $j$.

This hierarchical aggregation approach reduces communication overhead by aggregating updates locally before transmitting them across the network. It also enhances privacy by ensuring that individual node updates are combined with other updates before leaving the shard.

## 8.4 Cross-Shard Learning Coordination

Cross-shard learning coordination is essential for maintaining model consistency and quality across the sharded blockchain environment. QTrust implements a sophisticated coordination mechanism that balances learning effectiveness with minimal cross-shard communication.

### 8.4.1 Asynchronous Federated Learning

Traditional federated learning operates in synchronous rounds, requiring all participants to contribute before proceeding to the next round. This approach is impractical in blockchain environments where shards operate asynchronously and may have different computational capabilities. QTrust implements asynchronous federated learning that allows shards to proceed at their own pace:

1. **Local Phase**: Nodes in a shard train local models independently.
2. **Shard Aggregation Phase**: When a sufficient number of nodes in a shard have completed local training, the SAS aggregates their models.
3. **Global Contribution Phase**: Each shard contributes its aggregated model to the GMC when ready.
4. **Global Update Phase**: The GMC periodically updates the global model based on available shard models, without waiting for all shards.

This asynchronous approach is formalized as:

$M_{global}^{t+1} = M_{global}^t + \frac{\sum_{j \in AvailableShards_t} v_j \cdot (M_{shard}^{latest,j} - M_{global}^t)}{\sum_{j \in AvailableShards_t} v_j}$

Where $AvailableShards_t$ is the set of shards that have contributed updates since the last global aggregation.

### 8.4.2 Temporal Weighting

To address the challenge of staleness in asynchronous updates, we apply temporal weighting that reduces the influence of older updates:

$v_j' = v_j \cdot e^{-\lambda \cdot (t_{current} - t_{update,j})}$

Where:
- $\lambda$ is the decay factor
- $t_{current}$ is the current time
- $t_{update,j}$ is the time when shard $j$ generated its update

This approach ensures that more recent updates have greater influence on the global model, mitigating the effect of staleness while still utilizing all available information.

### 8.4.3 Cross-Shard Model Validation

To ensure that model updates do not compromise system integrity, QTrust implements a cross-validation mechanism where updates are validated before incorporation into the global model:

1. **Validation Shards Selection**: For each updating shard, a set of validator shards is randomly selected based on trust scores.

2. **Update Validation**: Validator shards evaluate the proposed update using a validation set:
   
   $ValidationScore(M_{proposed}, V) = Performance(M_{proposed}, V) - Performance(M_{current}, V)$

3. **Consensus-Based Acceptance**: The update is accepted if a majority of validator shards report positive validation scores.

This validation mechanism defends against poisoning attacks and ensures that model updates genuinely improve system performance.

## 8.5 Differential Privacy Implementation

Preserving privacy is a critical concern in QTrust's Federated Learning System. While federated learning inherently enhances privacy by keeping raw data local, additional measures are needed to prevent information leakage through model updates. QTrust implements differential privacy techniques to provide formal privacy guarantees.

### 8.5.1 Local Differential Privacy

Each node applies local differential privacy to its model updates before sharing them with the Shard Aggregation Server:

$\Delta \hat{M}_{local}^{t,i} = DP(\Delta M_{local}^{t,i}, \epsilon_{local})$

Where $DP$ is a differential privacy mechanism that ensures no individual transaction can significantly influence the model update. We implement this using the Gaussian mechanism:

$DP(x, \epsilon) = x + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \cdot I)$

Where:
- $\sigma$ is calibrated based on the sensitivity $S$ of the model update and the privacy parameter $\epsilon$:
  
  $\sigma = \frac{S \sqrt{2 \ln(1.25/\delta)}}{\epsilon}$
  
  with $\delta$ being a secondary privacy parameter.

The sensitivity $S$ is bounded by clipping model updates:

$\Delta \bar{M}_{local}^{t,i} = \Delta M_{local}^{t,i} \cdot \min\left(1, \frac{C}{||\Delta M_{local}^{t,i}||_2}\right)$

Where $C$ is the clipping threshold that bounds the maximum influence of any individual transaction.

### 8.5.2 Privacy Budget Management

To maintain meaningful privacy guarantees over time, QTrust implements a privacy budget management system that tracks privacy expenditure across learning rounds:

$\epsilon_{total} = \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T (\epsilon_t)^2}$

When the total privacy expenditure approaches a predefined budget $\epsilon_{max}$, the system takes adaptive measures, such as:

1. **Reducing Update Frequency**: Decreasing the frequency of model updates to conserve privacy budget
2. **Increasing Noise Levels**: Adding more noise to model updates for enhanced privacy
3. **Hierarchical Privacy Allocation**: Allocating privacy budget based on the criticality of different model components

### 8.5.3 Privacy-Utility Trade-off Optimization

QTrust dynamically optimizes the trade-off between privacy protection and model utility based on the current threat environment and performance requirements:

$\epsilon_t = OptimalPrivacy(ThreatLevel_t, PerformanceRequirement_t)$

The function $OptimalPrivacy$ selects the privacy parameter that minimizes a weighted combination of privacy loss and utility loss:

$OptimalPrivacy = \arg\min_{\epsilon} (w_{privacy} \cdot PrivacyLoss(\epsilon) + w_{utility} \cdot UtilityLoss(\epsilon))$

Where:
- $PrivacyLoss(\epsilon) = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{max}}$
- $UtilityLoss(\epsilon) = \frac{Performance(M_{no\text{-}noise}) - Performance(M_{\epsilon})}{Performance(M_{no\text{-}noise})}$
- $w_{privacy}$ and $w_{utility}$ are weights that depend on the current threat level

This adaptive approach ensures that QTrust provides strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high model performance.

## 8.6 Model Divergence Management

In federated learning, model divergence occurs when local models drift apart due to non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data distribution across nodes and shards. This divergence can lead to reduced model quality and system performance. QTrust implements several techniques to manage model divergence effectively.

### 8.6.1 FedProx with Adaptive Regularization

QTrust extends the FedProx algorithm [112] with adaptive regularization that adjusts based on observed divergence:

$\min_{M_{local}} L(M_{local}, D_i) + \frac{\mu_i}{2} ||M_{local} - M_{global}^t||^2$

The regularization parameter $\mu_i$ is adjusted for each node based on its observed divergence from the global model:

$\mu_i = \mu_{base} \cdot \left(1 + \alpha \cdot \frac{||M_{local}^{t-1,i} - M_{global}^{t-1}||_2}{||M_{global}^{t-1}||_2}\right)$

Where:
- $\mu_{base}$ is the base regularization parameter
- $\alpha$ is a scaling factor
- The fraction term measures the relative divergence of the node's previous model

This approach applies stronger regularization to nodes that exhibit greater divergence, encouraging model consistency while allowing for local specialization.

### 8.6.2 Knowledge Distillation

To further mitigate the effects of non-IID data, QTrust implements a knowledge distillation approach where local models learn from both their local data and the predictions of the global model:

$L_{KD}(M_{local}, D_i, M_{global}) = (1 - \lambda) \cdot L_{CE}(M_{local}, D_i) + \lambda \cdot L_{KL}(P_{local}, P_{global})$

Where:
- $L_{CE}$ is the standard cross-entropy loss on local data
- $L_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the local model's predictions $P_{local}$ and the global model's predictions $P_{global}$ on the same inputs
- $\lambda$ is a balancing parameter that controls the influence of the global model

This approach helps local models benefit from the global model's knowledge while still adapting to local data distributions.

### 8.6.3 Clustered Federated Learning

Recognizing that perfect model convergence may be neither possible nor desirable in a heterogeneous blockchain environment, QTrust implements clustered federated learning that allows for multiple specialized global models:

1. **Model Clustering**: After several rounds of standard federated learning, shard models are clustered based on their parameter space or functional behavior.

2. **Cluster-specific Aggregation**: Separate global models are maintained for each identified cluster:
   
   $M_{global,c}^{t+1} = \frac{\sum_{j \in Cluster_c} v_j \cdot M_{shard}^{t+1,j}}{\sum_{j \in Cluster_c} v_j}$

3. **Cluster Assignment**: Each shard is assigned to the cluster whose global model performs best on its local validation data.

4. **Inter-cluster Knowledge Transfer**: Knowledge is periodically transferred between cluster models through distillation or parameter sharing to prevent excessive specialization.

This approach balances the benefits of global knowledge sharing with the need for specialization in a heterogeneous environment.

## 8.7 Integration with QTrust Components

The Federated Learning System is tightly integrated with other QTrust components, enabling continuous improvement of decision-making capabilities across the system.

### 8.7.1 Integration with Rainbow DQN

The Federated Learning System trains and updates the neural networks used by the Rainbow DQN agents for transaction routing and shard optimization:

1. **Experience Sharing**: Nodes share anonymized experiences (state-action-reward-nextState tuples) for DRL training.

2. **Federated Policy Evaluation**: The value networks of Rainbow DQN are trained using federated learning to evaluate the quality of different states and actions.

3. **Local Policy Improvement**: Each node uses its local experiences to fine-tune the action selection policy, with regularization toward the federated model.

4. **Priority-Based Update**: More critical actions (e.g., routing high-value transactions) receive higher priority in the learning process.

### 8.7.2 Integration with HTDCM

The anomaly detection models used by the HTDCM are continuously improved through federated learning:

1. **Anomaly Model Training**: Nodes train local anomaly detection models on their observed behavior patterns.

2. **Federated Anomaly Knowledge**: The models are aggregated to create a global understanding of normal and abnormal behavior.

3. **Privacy-Preserving Attack Sharing**: Information about detected attacks is shared in a privacy-preserving manner to enhance system-wide detection capabilities.

4. **Trust-Weighted Aggregation**: Contributions to the anomaly detection models are weighted by node trust scores to reduce the influence of potentially compromised nodes.

### 8.7.3 Integration with MAD-RAPID

The congestion prediction models used by MAD-RAPID benefit from federated learning to improve routing decisions:

1. **Local Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Each shard analyzes its local traffic patterns and trains prediction models.

2. **Federated Traffic Intelligence**: The models are aggregated to create a global understanding of traffic patterns and congestion dynamics.

3. **Cross-Shard Prediction**: The federated models enable prediction of congestion in other shards, improving cross-shard routing decisions.

4. **Adaptive Route Planning**: The continuously updated models allow for adaptive route planning based on evolving network conditions.

## 8.8 Performance and Accuracy Analysis

To evaluate the effectiveness of QTrust's Federated Learning System, we conducted extensive experiments comparing it to alternative approaches for distributed intelligence in blockchain systems.

### 8.8.1 Communication Efficiency

Figure 14 illustrates the communication overhead of different approaches to distributed learning in the QTrust environment. The results show that our hierarchical federated learning approach with model compression reduces communication overhead by 94% compared to centralized learning and by 56% compared to standard federated learning.

### 8.8.2 Privacy Protection

Table 6 summarizes the privacy protection provided by different learning approaches under various reconstruction attacks. Differential privacy consistently provides the strongest protection, with successful reconstruction rates below 0.5% even under sophisticated attacks.

**Table 6: Privacy Protection Against Reconstruction Attacks**

| Learning Approach | Simple Inversion Attack | Model Inversion Attack | Membership Inference |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Centralized Learning | 87.3% success | 64.2% success | 92.1% success |
| Standard Federated Learning | 12.8% success | 28.3% success | 36.5% success |
| Federated Learning with DP (ε=1) | 0.4% success | 1.7% success | 3.2% success |
| QTrust's Approach (ε=1) | 0.2% success | 0.5% success | 0.8% success |

### 8.8.3 Model Quality

Figure 15 shows the evolution of model quality over time for different learning approaches. Despite the privacy-preserving mechanisms and reduced communication, QTrust's approach achieves 96% of the accuracy of centralized learning and outperforms standard federated learning by 8.5%. This is attributed to the effectiveness of the divergence management techniques and trust-weighted aggregation.

### 8.8.4 System Impact

Figure 16 illustrates the impact of the Federated Learning System on overall QTrust performance metrics. The continuous improvement of models through federated learning results in:
- 23% reduction in cross-shard transaction latency
- 18% increase in throughput
- 35% improvement in attack detection accuracy
- 12% reduction in energy consumption

These results demonstrate that QTrust's Federated Learning System successfully balances the competing objectives of privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and model quality, enabling continuous improvement of system intelligence without compromising node autonomy or data sovereignty.
