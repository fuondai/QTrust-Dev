# Security and Comparative Analysis

## 9.5 Security Analysis

We conducted extensive security analysis to evaluate QTrust's resistance to various attack vectors and its ability to maintain security properties under adverse conditions.

### 9.5.1 Byzantine Fault Tolerance

We evaluated Byzantine fault tolerance by introducing malicious nodes that exhibited various adversarial behaviors, including:
- Proposal of invalid blocks
- Withholding votes in consensus
- Double-voting
- Selective transaction censorship

Figure 25 shows system throughput as the percentage of Byzantine nodes increases from 0% to 33%. QTrust maintained over 90% of its throughput with up to 25% Byzantine nodes, compared to sharp declines in baseline systems beyond 15-20% Byzantine nodes. This enhanced resilience is primarily due to the HTDCM's ability to identify and isolate Byzantine nodes, reducing their influence on the system.

### 9.5.2 Sybil Attack Resistance

To evaluate Sybil attack resistance, we simulated attackers creating multiple identities to gain disproportionate influence. Figure 26 shows the relationship between attacker resources (as a percentage of honest resources) and attacker influence in the system.

QTrust limited attacker influence to 15% when controlling 30% of resources, compared to 29%, 25%, and 21% influence in the baseline systems. The multi-level trust evaluation in HTDCM was particularly effective at identifying coordinated behavior among Sybil nodes and reducing their trust scores accordingly.

### 9.5.3 Denial-of-Service Resistance

We evaluated DoS resistance by targeting specific shards with transaction floods and measuring system-wide impact. When the most heavily loaded shard was targeted with a 10x transaction volume increase, QTrust experienced a system-wide throughput reduction of only 14%, compared to 42%, 37%, and 29% for the baseline systems.

Figure 27 shows recovery time after a DoS attack ceases. QTrust recovered to 90% capacity within 2.1 minutes, significantly faster than the baseline systems' recovery times of 8.5, 6.3, and 4.7 minutes. This resilience stems from QTrust's ability to dynamically reshape and reroute transactions away from targeted shards.

### 9.5.4 Trust Evaluation Accuracy

We assessed the accuracy of QTrust's trust evaluation mechanism by comparing assigned trust scores with actual node reliability (measured as the percentage of correct behavior). Figure 28 shows a strong correlation (r = 0.91) between trust scores and actual reliability, with trust scores typically lagging changes in behavior by only 3-5 blocks.

The trust system successfully identified 94% of malicious nodes while maintaining a false positive rate of only 2.3%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-level approach that combines direct observations, reputation, and historical behavior.

## 9.6 Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art

Table 8 provides a comprehensive comparison of QTrust with state-of-the-art sharding systems across all key metrics:

**Table 8: Comparative Analysis of Sharding Systems**

| Metric | QTrust | Ethereum 2.0 | Polkadot | Harmony |
|--------|--------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Peak Throughput (TPS) | 42,500 | 24,600 | 28,100 | 33,000 |
| Avg. Latency (sec) | 1.2 | 3.2 | 2.1 | 1.8 |
| Cross-shard Latency (sec) | 2.3 | 7.2 | 5.1 | 4.2 |
| Scalability (% of linear) | 86% | 64% | 71% | 79% |
| Byzantine Tolerance (%) | 33% | 33% | 33% | 33% |
| Effective Byzantine Resistance (%)* | 28% | 18% | 21% | 23% |
| Energy per Txn (J) | 0.15 | 0.32 | 0.28 | 0.23 |
| Adaptive to Load Changes | High | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Cross-shard Txn Efficiency | 72% | 31% | 42% | 54% |
| Network Overhead per Txn (KB) | 2.3 | 5.8 | 4.6 | 3.5 |

*Effective Byzantine Resistance measures the maximum percentage of Byzantine nodes that can be tolerated while maintaining at least 80% throughput.

QTrust outperforms the state-of-the-art across most metrics, with particularly significant advantages in throughput, cross-shard transaction efficiency, and adaptability to changing conditions. While all systems provide theoretical 33% Byzantine fault tolerance, QTrust's effective resistance is substantially higher due to its ability to identify and isolate malicious nodes.
