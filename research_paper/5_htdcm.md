# Hierarchical Trust-based Data Center Mechanism (HTDCM)

## 5.1 Trust Evaluation in Blockchain Sharding: Challenges and Requirements

Trust evaluation in blockchain systems has traditionally relied on simple binary or threshold-based mechanisms that fail to capture the nuanced behavior of nodes in complex, adversarial environments. In sharded blockchain networks, these limitations are amplified as malicious actors need only compromise a single shard rather than the entire network. This section introduces the Hierarchical Trust-based Data Center Mechanism (HTDCM), a novel trust evaluation framework designed specifically for sharded blockchain environments.

The requirements for effective trust evaluation in sharded blockchains extend beyond those of traditional blockchain systems:

1. **Multi-level Evaluation**: Trust must be assessed at both node and shard levels to detect localized and distributed threats.
2. **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: The system must identify suspicious temporal patterns that may indicate coordinated attacks.
3. **Contextual Awareness**: Trust evaluations must consider transaction context, including value and criticality.
4. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Detection thresholds must adapt to network conditions and observed behavior patterns.
5. **Cross-validation**: Trust assessments must be cross-validated across multiple dimensions to prevent gaming of the system.
6. **Computational Efficiency**: Trust calculations must be efficient to maintain network performance.

Existing approaches fail to address these requirements comprehensively. Reputation-based systems like EigenTrust [51] and PeerTrust [52] lack the hierarchical structure needed for sharded environments. Context-aware approaches [103] typically focus on single-layer evaluations without cross-validation. Machine learning techniques have been applied to anomaly detection in blockchain [104] but not integrated into a comprehensive trust framework.

HTDCM addresses these limitations through a multi-layered approach that combines traditional trust metrics with machine learning-based anomaly detection, temporal pattern analysis, and cross-validation mechanisms. The result is a robust trust evaluation system capable of detecting sophisticated attacks while maintaining computational efficiency.

## 5.2 HTDCM Architecture and Components

The HTDCM architecture consists of five primary components organized in a hierarchical structure, as illustrated in Figure 3. Each component serves a specific function in the overall trust evaluation process:

1. **Node Trust Evaluator (NTE)**: Assesses individual nodes based on transaction history, response times, and peer ratings.
2. **Shard Trust Aggregator (STA)**: Combines node-level trust scores into shard-level assessments.
3. **Machine Learning Anomaly Detector (MLAD)**: Employs unsupervised learning to identify unusual node behavior.
4. **Pattern Recognition System (PRS)**: Analyzes temporal patterns to detect coordinated malicious activities.
5. **Trust Integration Manager (TIM)**: Integrates all trust evaluations and interfaces with other QTrust components.

These components interact in a hierarchical manner, with lower-level components providing input to higher-level components. The NTE operates continuously, evaluating each node's behavior as transactions are processed. The STA periodically aggregates node-level scores to assess shard security. The MLAD and PRS operate in parallel, analyzing behavior patterns and providing input to the TIM. The TIM then integrates all evaluations to produce final trust scores that are used by other QTrust components.

Formally, we define the HTDCM as:

$HTDCM = (NTE, STA, MLAD, PRS, TIM)$

Where:
- $NTE: N \times T \rightarrow [0,1]$ maps nodes and transaction data to node trust scores
- $STA: 2^N \times S \rightarrow [0,1]$ maps sets of nodes and shard data to shard trust scores
- $MLAD: N \times B \rightarrow [0,1] \times \{0,1\}$ maps nodes and their behavior to anomaly scores and detection flags
- $PRS: 2^N \times P \rightarrow 2^A$ maps sets of nodes and their activity patterns to detected attack types
- $TIM: NT \times ST \times AD \times AT \rightarrow NT' \times ST'$ integrates trust data to produce updated trust scores

Where $N$ is the set of nodes, $T$ is transaction data, $S$ is shard data, $B$ is behavior data, $P$ is pattern data, $A$ is the set of attack types, $NT$ is the set of node trust scores, $ST$ is the set of shard trust scores, $AD$ is anomaly detection data, and $AT$ is attack detection data.

## 5.3 Multi-level Trust Evaluation Metrics and Calculations

### 5.3.1 Node-Level Trust Evaluation

The Node Trust Evaluator calculates trust scores for individual nodes based on multiple factors:

1. **Transaction Success Rate (TSR)**: The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions:
   
   $TSR_i = \frac{S_i}{S_i + F_i}$
   
   where $S_i$ is the number of successful transactions and $F_i$ is the number of failed transactions for node $i$.

2. **Response Time Rating (RTR)**: A normalized rating based on response times:
   
   $RTR_i = \max\left(0, 1 - \frac{RT_i - RT_{min}}{RT_{max} - RT_{min}}\right)$
   
   where $RT_i$ is the average response time of node $i$, and $RT_{min}$ and $RT_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum acceptable response times.

3. **Peer Rating (PR)**: The average rating given by other nodes:
   
   $PR_i = \frac{1}{|P_i|} \sum_{j \in P_i} r_{j,i}$
   
   where $P_i$ is the set of peers that have rated node $i$, and $r_{j,i}$ is the rating given by node $j$ to node $i$.

4. **Historical Trust (HT)**: The node's previous trust score, weighted to provide stability:
   
   $HT_i(t) = \alpha \cdot NT_i(t-1) + (1-\alpha) \cdot NT_i(t-2)$
   
   where $NT_i(t-1)$ is the node's trust score in the previous evaluation period, and $\alpha$ is a weighting factor.

The overall node trust score is calculated as a weighted combination of these factors, with an additional penalty for detected malicious activities:

$NT_i = w_{TSR} \cdot TSR_i + w_{RTR} \cdot RTR_i + w_{PR} \cdot PR_i + w_{HT} \cdot HT_i - p_{MA} \cdot MA_i$

where $w_{TSR}$, $w_{RTR}$, $w_{PR}$, and $w_{HT}$ are weight coefficients, $MA_i$ is the count of malicious activities detected for node $i$, and $p_{MA}$ is the penalty factor for malicious activities.

The weights are dynamically adjusted based on observed correlations between each factor and overall network health:

$w_j(t+1) = w_j(t) + \eta \cdot \frac{\partial Performance}{\partial w_j}$

where $\eta$ is a learning rate, and $\frac{\partial Performance}{\partial w_j}$ is the estimated gradient of network performance with respect to weight $w_j$.

### 5.3.2 Shard-Level Trust Evaluation

The Shard Trust Aggregator calculates trust scores for entire shards based on the trust scores of constituent nodes and shard-level metrics:

1. **Average Node Trust (ANT)**: The weighted average of node trust scores:
   
   $ANT_s = \frac{\sum_{i \in N_s} w_i \cdot NT_i}{\sum_{i \in N_s} w_i}$
   
   where $N_s$ is the set of nodes in shard $s$, $NT_i$ is the trust score of node $i$, and $w_i$ is a weight based on the node's historical reliability.

2. **Trust Distribution (TD)**: A measure of how evenly trust is distributed across nodes:
   
   $TD_s = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i \in N_s} (NT_i - ANT_s)^2}{|N_s|}}$
   
   A lower variance indicates more consistent behavior across nodes, which is generally desirable.

3. **Malicious Concentration (MC)**: The concentration of detected malicious activities:
   
   $MC_s = \frac{\max_{i \in N_s} MA_i}{\sum_{i \in N_s} MA_i + \epsilon}$
   
   where $MA_i$ is the count of malicious activities detected for node $i$, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero. A high concentration suggests targeted malicious activity.

4. **Cross-Shard Consistency (CSC)**: The consistency of trust assessments across shards:
   
   $CSC_s = \frac{1}{|N_s|} \sum_{i \in N_s} \frac{1}{|S_i|} \sum_{j \in S_i} \delta(NT_{i,j}, NT_i)$
   
   where $S_i$ is the set of shards that have assessed node $i$, $NT_{i,j}$ is the trust assessment of node $i$ by shard $j$, and $\delta$ is a similarity function.

The overall shard trust score is calculated as:

$ST_s = w_{ANT} \cdot ANT_s + w_{TD} \cdot TD_s - w_{MC} \cdot MC_s + w_{CSC} \cdot CSC_s$

where $w_{ANT}$, $w_{TD}$, $w_{MC}$, and $w_{CSC}$ are weight coefficients that balance the importance of each factor.

## 5.4 Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection

The Machine Learning Anomaly Detector employs unsupervised learning techniques to identify unusual node behavior that may indicate malicious activity. Unlike rule-based approaches that rely on predefined patterns, the MLAD can detect novel attack vectors by identifying deviations from normal behavior.

### 5.4.1 Feature Extraction

For each node, we extract a comprehensive set of features that capture various aspects of behavior:

1. **Transaction Features**: Average value, volume, type distribution, and temporal patterns
2. **Network Features**: Connection patterns, message frequency, and propagation behavior
3. **Performance Features**: Response times, resource utilization, and throughput
4. **Consistency Features**: Variance in behavior across different time periods and transaction types

These features are normalized and transformed into a feature vector $\mathbf{f}_i$ for each node $i$.

### 5.4.2 Anomaly Detection Models

We employ a combination of three complementary anomaly detection techniques to maximize detection accuracy while minimizing false positives:

1. **Isolation Forest** [105]: Isolates anomalies by randomly selecting features and split values, effectively identifying outliers with fewer splits. The anomaly score is calculated as:
   
   $s(x, n) = 2^{-\frac{E(h(x))}{c(n)}}$
   
   where $E(h(x))$ is the average path length for data point $x$, and $c(n)$ is the average path length of an unsuccessful search in a binary search tree.

2. **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** [106]: Measures the local deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors, identifying regions of similar density. The LOF score is:
   
   $LOF_k(x) = \frac{\sum_{y \in N_k(x)} \frac{lrd_k(y)}{lrd_k(x)}}{|N_k(x)|}$
   
   where $lrd_k(x)$ is the local reachability density of point $x$, and $N_k(x)$ is the set of $k$-nearest neighbors.

3. **Autoencoder** [107]: A neural network trained to reconstruct input data, where reconstruction error indicates anomaly. The anomaly score is:
   
   $s(x) = ||x - g(f(x))||^2$
   
   where $f$ and $g$ are the encoder and decoder functions, respectively.

The final anomaly score is a weighted combination of these three models:

$AS_i = w_{IF} \cdot s_{IF}(f_i) + w_{LOF} \cdot s_{LOF}(f_i) + w_{AE} \cdot s_{AE}(f_i)$

where $w_{IF}$, $w_{LOF}$, and $w_{AE}$ are weights assigned to each model based on their historical performance.

### 5.4.3 Adaptive Thresholding

Traditional fixed thresholds for anomaly detection are inadequate in dynamic blockchain environments. We implement an adaptive thresholding approach that adjusts based on the distribution of anomaly scores and network conditions:

$T(t) = \mu(t) + \beta(t) \cdot \sigma(t)$

where $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma(t)$ are the mean and standard deviation of recent anomaly scores, and $\beta(t)$ is a factor that varies based on network conditions:

$\beta(t) = \beta_0 + \Delta\beta \cdot \tanh(\gamma \cdot ThreatLevel(t))$

where $ThreatLevel(t)$ is an estimate of the current threat level based on recent attack detections and network performance.

## 5.5 Advanced Attack Detection Capabilities

The Pattern Recognition System builds upon the anomaly detection capabilities of the MLAD to identify specific attack patterns that may affect sharded blockchain networks. It employs a combination of rule-based detection and machine learning to identify sophisticated attacks:

### 5.5.1 Sybil Attack Detection

Sybil attacks involve a single entity creating multiple identities to gain disproportionate influence. The PRS detects Sybil attacks through:

1. **Identity Clustering**: Clustering nodes based on behavior similarity and network characteristics
   
   $Similarity(i, j) = exp\left(-\frac{||f_i - f_j||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$
   
   where $f_i$ and $f_j$ are the feature vectors of nodes $i$ and $j$.

2. **Synchronized Behavior Detection**: Identifying nodes that exhibit highly correlated behavior over time
   
   $Correlation(i, j) = \frac{Cov(B_i, B_j)}{\sigma_{B_i} \cdot \sigma_{B_j}}$
   
   where $B_i$ and $B_j$ are the behavior sequences of nodes $i$ and $j$.

3. **Node Creation Patterns**: Analyzing temporal patterns in node creation and activation
   
   $CreationAnomaly = \frac{NumCreated_{window} - HistoricalAvg}{HistoricalStd}$

When multiple indicators exceed their respective thresholds, a Sybil attack alert is triggered with an associated confidence score.

### 5.5.2 Eclipse Attack Detection

Eclipse attacks target specific nodes by monopolizing their connections, isolating them from the honest network. The PRS detects eclipse attacks through:

1. **Connection Pattern Analysis**: Monitoring changes in connection patterns for nodes
   
   $ConnectionAnomalyScore(i) = \frac{||C_i^t - C_i^{t-\Delta t}||_1}{|C_i^{t-\Delta t}|}$
   
   where $C_i^t$ is the connection vector (representing connections to other nodes) for node $i$ at time $t$.

2. **Information Propagation Tracking**: Tracking how information propagates through the network
   
   $PropagationDelay(i) = \frac{AverageDelay_i - NetworkAverageDelay}{NetworkStdDelay}$

3. **Transaction Validation Discrepancy**: Identifying discrepancies in transaction validation between potentially eclipsed nodes and the rest of the network
   
   $ValidationDiscrepancy(i) = \frac{|V_i \triangle V_{network}|}{|V_{network}|}$
   
   where $V_i$ is the set of transactions validated by node $i$, $V_{network}$ is the set validated by the network, and $\triangle$ denotes symmetric difference.

### 5.5.3 Cross-Shard Attack Detection

Cross-shard attacks exploit vulnerabilities in cross-shard transaction protocols to double-spend or corrupt the system state. The PRS detects these attacks through:

1. **Transaction Graph Analysis**: Analyzing the graph of related transactions across shards
   
   $G_{tx} = (V_{tx}, E_{tx})$, where $V_{tx}$ are transactions and $E_{tx}$ represent dependencies
   
   Suspicious patterns in this graph, such as cycles or unusual fan-out structures, may indicate attacks.

2. **Temporal Consistency Checking**: Verifying that the sequence of events across shards is consistent
   
   $TemporalInconsistency = \max_{i,j \in RelatedTx} |t_i - t_j - ExpectedDelay(i, j)|$

3. **State Transition Verification**: Ensuring that state transitions across shards are valid
   
   $StateInconsistency = ||ActualState - ExpectedState||$

### 5.5.4 Coordinated Attack Detection

Sophisticated attackers may launch coordinated attacks involving multiple vectors simultaneously. The PRS employs a hierarchical detection approach to identify such attacks:

1. **Multi-dimensional Clustering**: Clustering suspicious activities across multiple dimensions
   
   $C = HDBSCAN(Activities, \epsilon, minPts)$
   
   where $HDBSCAN$ is a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm.

2. **Temporal Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing the temporal correlation of suspicious activities
   
   $TemporalCorrelation(A, B) = \frac{|t_A - t_B|}{\max(Duration(A), Duration(B))}$

3. **Attack Pattern Matching**: Matching observed patterns against a library of known attack signatures
   
   $PatternSimilarity(P_{observed}, P_{known}) = SimilarityFunction(P_{observed}, P_{known})$

When a coordinated attack is detected, the system employs targeted countermeasures to mitigate the threat, such as isolating affected nodes, temporarily modifying consensus protocols, or implementing emergency resharding.

## 5.6 Trust Score Integration with Other QTrust Components

The Trust Integration Manager serves as the interface between HTDCM and other QTrust components, ensuring that trust evaluations influence system behavior appropriately:

### 5.6.1 Integration with Rainbow DQN

Node and shard trust scores are incorporated into the state representation of the Rainbow DQN agent, influencing transaction routing decisions:

$s_t = [..., NT_1, NT_2, ..., NT_n, ST_1, ST_2, ..., ST_m, ...]$

Additionally, trust scores affect the reward function by modifying the security component:

$r_{security} = f(a_t, s_t, NT, ST)$

where $f$ is a function that evaluates the security implications of action $a_t$ in state $s_t$ given the current trust scores.

### 5.6.2 Integration with Adaptive Consensus

Trust scores directly influence consensus protocol selection through the AdaptiveConsensus module:

$ProtocolSelection(tx, s_t) = argmax_p (SecurityFactor_p \cdot TrustNeed(tx) + PerformanceFactor_p \cdot (1 - TrustNeed(tx)))$

where $TrustNeed(tx)$ is a function that maps transaction characteristics and destination shard trust to a value representing the need for a secure consensus protocol:

$TrustNeed(tx) = w_{value} \cdot \frac{Value(tx)}{MaxValue} + w_{trust} \cdot (1 - ST_{dest})$

Low-trust environments trigger the selection of more robust consensus protocols, while high-trust environments may use lighter, more efficient protocols.

### 5.6.3 Integration with MAD-RAPID Router

Trust scores influence routing decisions through the MAD-RAPID router by modifying the path cost function:

$Cost(p, t) = ... + w_{trust} \cdot \sum_{s \in p} (1 - ST_s)$

Paths through low-trust shards are assigned higher costs, making them less likely to be selected unless other factors (such as congestion or latency) strongly favor them.

### 5.6.4 Integration with Federated Learning

Trust scores determine the weight assigned to each node's model updates in the federated learning process:

$gm^{t+1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k |D_i| \cdot NT_i \cdot lm_i^{t+1}}{\sum_{i=1}^k |D_i| \cdot NT_i}$

Nodes with higher trust scores have more influence on the global model, while updates from low-trust nodes are discounted or potentially excluded altogether.

### 5.6.5 Dynamic Response System

Beyond passive influence through trust scores, HTDCM includes a Dynamic Response System (DRS) that actively responds to detected threats:

1. **Alert Generation**: When significant threats are detected, the DRS generates alerts with associated confidence levels and recommended actions.

2. **Automatic Countermeasures**: For high-confidence detections, the DRS can automatically implement countermeasures such as:
   - Temporarily blacklisting suspicious nodes
   - Initiating emergency resharding to isolate compromised shards
   - Increasing security parameters for affected regions of the network
   - Implementing rate limiting for suspicious transactions

3. **Recovery Coordination**: After an attack is mitigated, the DRS coordinates recovery procedures to restore normal operation, including:
   - Gradual reintegration of quarantined nodes (with probationary status)
   - State verification and reconciliation
   - Trust score recalibration

This active response capability distinguishes HTDCM from passive trust evaluation systems, enabling QTrust to not only detect but also respond to threats in real-time.

## 5.7 Experimental Validation

To validate the effectiveness of HTDCM, we conducted a series of experiments simulating various attack scenarios. For each scenario, we measured HTDCM's detection accuracy, false positive rate, response time, and impact on overall system performance. Table 2 summarizes the results for key attack types.

**Table 2: HTDCM Detection Performance**

| Attack Type | Detection Rate | False Positive Rate | Average Detection Time | Performance Impact |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Sybil Attack | 94.2% | 1.3% | 8.7s | 2.1% |
| Eclipse Attack | 89.6% | 2.5% | 12.3s | 3.4% |
| Cross-Shard Attack | 92.1% | 1.8% | 7.5s | 2.8% |
| Coordinated Attack | 88.5% | 3.1% | 15.6s | 4.2% |

These results demonstrate HTDCM's effectiveness in detecting and responding to diverse attack vectors with minimal impact on system performance. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, HTDCM achieves 27% higher detection rates while reducing false positives by 41%, enabling QTrust to maintain robust security in adversarial environments.
