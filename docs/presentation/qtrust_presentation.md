# QTrust: Technical Presentation

## 1. Introduction to QTrust and Blockchain Sharding

### Challenges in Contemporary Blockchain Systems

Current blockchain systems face significant scalability limitations:

- **Limited Throughput**: Ethereum processes only 15-20 tx/s, Bitcoin merely 7 tx/s
- **High Latency**: Transaction confirmation times range from minutes to hours
- **Excessive Energy Consumption**: Particularly prevalent in Proof-of-Work consensus mechanisms
- **Prohibitive Transaction Costs**: Due to resource constraints and competitive demand
- **Security-Performance Trade-off**: Balancing decentralization with efficiency remains challenging

### Sharding Solutions and Their Inherent Challenges

Sharding partitions blockchain data and processing into smaller segments (shards):

- **Advantages**:
  - Parallel processing substantially increases overall throughput
  - Reduces storage requirements for individual nodes
  - Enables linear scalability proportional to shard count

- **Challenges**:
  - Cross-shard transactions introduce complexity and elevated computational costs
  - Individual shard security is inherently weaker than whole-network security
  - Load balancing across heterogeneous shards proves difficult
  - Synchronization and consistency between shards present technical hurdles

### QTrust Vision and Innovation

QTrust addresses these challenges through multiple novel approaches:

- Optimization of routing and consensus through Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Implementation of adaptive consensus mechanisms based on network conditions
- Application of hierarchical trust evaluation to enhance security
- Federated learning for efficient model training without compromising data privacy
- Intelligent caching systems to reduce latency and resource consumption

QTrust targets breakthrough performance metrics: throughput of 1,240 tx/s, latency of only 1.2 seconds, and energy consumption reduced by 80% compared to current standards.
