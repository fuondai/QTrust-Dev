# Performance and Scalability Analysis

## 9.3 Performance Evaluation

Our performance evaluation focused on QTrust's ability to process transactions efficiently while maintaining security and decentralization properties.

### 9.3.1 Throughput Analysis

Figure 17 illustrates the throughput achieved by QTrust under different workload patterns compared to baseline systems. QTrust consistently outperformed the baseline systems, achieving:
- 42,500 TPS with uniform workload
- 38,200 TPS with skewed workload
- 40,100 TPS with temporal pattern workload

This represents a **73% improvement** over Ethereum 2.0, **51% improvement** over Polkadot, and **29% improvement** over Harmony under comparable configurations. The advantage was particularly pronounced under skewed workload distributions, where QTrust's DRL-based load balancing demonstrated superior adaptation.

The most significant factor contributing to QTrust's throughput advantage was the Rainbow DQN's ability to dynamically optimize shard composition and transaction routing. Figure 18 shows how the system dynamically adjusted shard compositions in response to changing load patterns, maintaining balanced utilization across shards even under highly skewed workloads.

### 9.3.2 Latency Analysis

Table 7 summarizes the latency measurements across different transaction types and workloads:

**Table 7: Latency Measurements (seconds)**

| System | Simple Txns (P50/P95/P99) | Smart Contract Txns (P50/P95/P99) | Cross-Shard Txns (P50/P95/P99) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| QTrust | 0.8/1.2/1.7 | 1.2/1.9/2.4 | 1.6/2.3/3.1 |
| Ethereum 2.0 | 2.1/3.4/5.2 | 3.2/4.8/6.3 | 4.5/7.2/9.8 |
| Polkadot | 1.5/2.3/3.8 | 2.1/3.5/4.9 | 3.4/5.1/7.3 |
| Harmony | 1.1/1.7/2.5 | 1.8/2.7/3.8 | 2.9/4.2/5.4 |

QTrust demonstrated significantly lower latency across all transaction types, with particularly notable improvements in cross-shard transactions, where it achieved **65% lower P99 latency** compared to Ethereum 2.0 and **43% lower** than Harmony. This improvement is primarily attributable to the MAD-RAPID router's predictive routing optimization and the adaptive consensus selection mechanism.

Figure 19 shows the latency distribution for cross-shard transactions under varying load conditions. QTrust maintained consistent latency even at high loads, while baseline systems showed exponential latency increases as the system approached capacity.

### 9.3.3 Resource Utilization

QTrust's resource utilization patterns revealed efficient use of computational and network resources:

- **CPU Utilization**: 62% average across nodes at peak throughput
- **Memory Usage**: 24GB average per node at peak throughput
- **Network Bandwidth**: 780 Mbps average per node at peak throughput
- **Storage Growth**: 18GB per hour at peak throughput

Figure 20 compares resource utilization across systems at equivalent throughput levels. QTrust showed **22% lower CPU utilization** and **31% lower bandwidth consumption** compared to the average of baseline systems, demonstrating the efficiency benefits of its intelligent resource allocation.

## 9.4 Scalability Analysis

We evaluated QTrust's scalability by varying the number of shards and nodes per shard, as well as analyzing its behavior under different load distributions.

### 9.4.1 Horizontal Scalability

Figure 21 illustrates throughput scaling as the number of shards increases from 4 to 64. QTrust demonstrated near-linear scaling up to 32 shards, with some diminishing returns beyond that point due to increased cross-shard coordination overhead. At 64 shards, QTrust achieved 86% of ideal linear scaling, compared to 64%, 71%, and 79% for Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, and Harmony, respectively.

The key factors enabling QTrust's superior scaling properties include:
1. Intelligent cross-shard transaction routing that minimizes coordination overhead
2. Dynamic resharding that balances load across shards
3. Adaptive consensus selection that optimizes for throughput when security requirements permit

### 9.4.2 Load Adaptability

We evaluated adaptability by introducing sudden load shifts, where 50% of transaction volume moved from one subset of shards to another over a 10-minute period. Figure 22 shows the throughput response during this transition period.

QTrust's throughput dipped by only 12% during the transition and recovered within 4 minutes, compared to dips of 38%, 31%, and 23% for Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, and Harmony, with recovery times of 15, 12, and 9 minutes, respectively. This demonstrates QTrust's superior ability to detect and adapt to changing load patterns through its DRL-based optimization.

### 9.4.3 Shard Balance

Figure 23 shows the standard deviation of transaction load across shards under skewed workload conditions. QTrust maintained a standard deviation of 18% from mean load per shard, compared to 47%, 39%, and 28% for the baseline systems. This improved balance translates directly to better resource utilization and higher overall throughput.

### 9.4.4 Cross-Shard Transaction Efficiency

Cross-shard transactions typically impose higher overhead than intra-shard transactions due to coordination requirements. We measured the relative throughput of cross-shard transactions as a percentage of intra-shard throughput. QTrust achieved 72% relative throughput for cross-shard transactions, compared to 31%, 42%, and 54% for the baseline systems.

Figure 24 shows how this efficiency varies with the percentage of cross-shard transactions in the workload. QTrust maintained higher relative efficiency even as cross-shard transaction percentage increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MAD-RAPID router in optimizing cross-shard communication.
