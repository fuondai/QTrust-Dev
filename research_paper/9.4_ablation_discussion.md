# Ablation Studies and Discussion

## 9.7 Ablation Studies

To understand the relative contribution of each component to QTrust's overall performance and identify any potential bottlenecks, we conducted a series of ablation studies. In each experiment, we selectively disabled or replaced key components of the system and measured the impact on performance metrics.

### 9.7.1 Rainbow DQN Analysis

We evaluated several variants of the Rainbow DQN agent to understand which components contributed most significantly to performance improvements:

1. **Base DQN**: Standard Deep Q-Network without Rainbow enhancements
2. **Rainbow without Prioritized Experience Replay**
3. **Rainbow without Dueling Networks**
4. **Rainbow without Noisy Networks**
5. **Rainbow without Distributional RL**
6. **Full Rainbow DQN** (our approach)

Figure 29 shows the throughput achieved by each variant under skewed workload conditions. The full Rainbow DQN outperformed all ablated variants, with a 27% improvement over the base DQN. The most significant contributions came from Prioritized Experience Replay and Distributional RL, which individually accounted for 12% and 9% improvements, respectively. This analysis demonstrates the importance of capturing distribution information and focusing training on important experiences in the blockchain sharding context.

We also examined how quickly each variant converged to stable performance after a sudden load shift. The full Rainbow DQN adapted within 4 minutes, while the base DQN required 11 minutes to reach comparable performance levels. This highlights the importance of advanced RL techniques in achieving QTrust's rapid adaptability to changing conditions.

### 9.7.2 HTDCM Component Analysis

To evaluate the contribution of each component within the Hierarchical Trust-based Data Center Mechanism, we conducted experiments with various configurations:

1. **Direct observation only**: Trust based solely on direct interactions
2. **Reputation only**: Trust based solely on reported observations
3. **Historical behavior only**: Trust based solely on past performance
4. **Pairwise combinations**: Direct + Reputation, Direct + Historical, Reputation + Historical
5. **Full HTDCM** (our approach)

Figure 30 shows the effective Byzantine resistance (percentage of Byzantine nodes tolerated while maintaining 80% throughput) for each configuration. The full HTDCM achieved 28% resistance, significantly outperforming all ablated variants. The strongest pairwise combination (Direct + Historical) achieved only 21% resistance, demonstrating the complementary nature of all three trust components.

We also analyzed false positive rates for malicious node detection across configurations. The full HTDCM maintained a 2.3% false positive rate, while the best ablated variant (Direct + Historical) had a 5.7% false positive rate. This confirms that the multi-level approach effectively filters out noise and transient failures that might otherwise be misclassified as malicious behavior.

## 9.8 Discussion of Results

Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates QTrust's significant advantages over existing sharding solutions across multiple dimensions. In this section, we discuss the implications of these results, identify remaining challenges, and suggest directions for future work.

### 9.8.1 Sources of Performance Improvement

QTrust's performance advantages stem from several synergistic components:

1. **Intelligent Shard Composition**: By dynamically resharding based on transaction patterns, QTrust reduces cross-shard transactions by 37% compared to static sharding approaches. This directly translates to higher throughput and lower latency, as cross-shard transactions require more complex coordination.

2. **Predictive Routing**: The MAD-RAPID router's predictive capabilities allow it to anticipate congestion and route transactions optimally. This reduces average cross-shard transaction latency by 59% compared to shortest-path routing algorithms used in baseline systems.

3. **Trust-Aware Consensus**: By selecting consensus participants based on trust scores, QTrust reduces the overhead of BFT consensus protocols while maintaining security guarantees. Trust-aware selection reduces consensus message complexity by 43% compared to random selection.

4. **Federated Learning Optimization**: The continuous optimization of system parameters through federated learning allows QTrust to adapt to changing network conditions without centralized coordination. This improves throughput by 18% compared to fixed parameter configurations.

The combination of these improvements creates a multiplicative effect that explains QTrust's overall performance advantage over baseline systems.

### 9.8.2 Scalability Limitations

While QTrust demonstrates near-linear scaling up to 32 shards, we observed diminishing returns beyond this point. Analysis revealed several factors contributing to this limitation:

1. **Cross-Shard Coordination Overhead**: As the number of shards increases, the likelihood of cross-shard transactions also increases, leading to higher coordination overhead. This is an inherent limitation of sharded blockchain architectures.

2. **Communication Complexity**: The number of potential communication paths grows quadratically with the number of shards, increasing routing complexity and network overhead.

3. **State Synchronization**: Maintaining synchronized state across a larger number of shards requires more frequent state updates, increasing background network traffic.

These limitations suggest that extremely large-scale deployments might benefit from hierarchical sharding approaches or more sophisticated cross-shard transaction protocols. Future work will explore these directions to push the scalability limits further.

### 9.8.3 Security-Performance Trade-offs

Our security analysis revealed interesting trade-offs between security guarantees and performance. While QTrust maintains higher throughput than baseline systems even with high percentages of Byzantine nodes, there is an inevitable degradation as adversarial presence increases.

The relationship between trust threshold settings and performance highlights this trade-off. Lowering trust thresholds for consensus participation increases performance but reduces security margins. Conversely, higher thresholds enhance security at the cost of reduced throughput. QTrust's adaptive approach attempts to find the optimal balance based on detected threat levels, but this remains an important consideration for real-world deployments.

### 9.8.4 Energy Efficiency Considerations

One notable finding from our evaluation is QTrust's significant improvement in energy efficiency compared to baseline systems. The 53% reduction in energy per transaction compared to Ethereum 2.0 and 35% compared to Harmony is particularly relevant given the growing focus on blockchain sustainability.

This improvement stems primarily from:
1. More efficient consensus participant selection
2. Reduced message complexity in cross-shard transactions
3. Better load balancing that prevents idle resources
4. Dynamic consensus selection that can choose lighter protocols when appropriate

The energy savings become even more pronounced at scale, making QTrust particularly suitable for large-scale enterprise or public blockchain deployments where energy consumption is a concern.

### 9.8.5 Practical Implications

Our results have several important implications for practical blockchain deployments:

1. **Shard Size Optimization**: We found that shard sizes of 50-80 nodes provide the optimal balance between security and performance across most workloads. Smaller shards suffer from reduced security margins, while larger shards experience higher coordination overhead.

2. **Cross-Shard Transaction Management**: Applications should be designed to minimize cross-shard transactions whenever possible. Even with QTrust's optimizations, cross-shard transactions remain more expensive than intra-shard ones.

3. **Trust Mechanism Configuration**: The sensitivity and weights of the trust evaluation components should be tuned based on the expected threat model. Networks with higher risk of Sybil attacks should prioritize features that detect coordinated behavior.

4. **Resource Provisioning**: QTrust's ability to dynamically adapt to varying loads enables more efficient resource provisioning. Rather than provisioning for peak loads, deployments can optimize for average loads and rely on the system's adaptability to handle spikes.

These considerations can guide real-world implementations of QTrust and similar blockchain sharding systems.

### 9.8.6 Limitations and Future Work

While QTrust demonstrates significant improvements over existing systems, several limitations and opportunities for future work remain:

1. **Initialization Time**: The DRL components require a warm-up period to reach optimal performance. Future work will explore transfer learning approaches to reduce this initialization time.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Some components, particularly in the trust evaluation system, are sensitive to parameter settings. Automated parameter tuning mechanisms could further improve robustness.

3. **Complex Smart Contract Support**: Our evaluation focused primarily on transaction throughput with relatively simple smart contracts. More complex contracts may introduce additional challenges that require specialized optimizations.

4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: While empirical results demonstrate QTrust's effectiveness, stronger theoretical guarantees about convergence properties and security bounds would enhance confidence in the system.

5. **Cross-Ledger Interactions**: Integration with external blockchain systems presents additional challenges that were not addressed in this work. Future research will explore cross-ledger communication protocols.

Addressing these limitations will further enhance QTrust's applicability to diverse blockchain use cases and deployment scenarios.
