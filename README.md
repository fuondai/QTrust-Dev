### Benchmark Methodology

The QTrust project uses a specifically designed benchmark process to evaluate blockchain performance fairly and accurately:

1. **Standardized Testing Environment**:
   - AWS c5.4xlarge instances (16 vCPUs, 32GB RAM)
   - 10Gbps network
   - Realistic network latency simulation: 50-200ms
   - 1000 nodes distributed across 5 geographic regions

2. **Transaction Workload**:
   - Maximum of 10,000 transactions/second
   - Transaction mix: 70% simple value transfers, 20% contract calls, 10% contract deployments
   - Zipfian distribution to simulate hot spots

3. **Attack Scenarios**:
   - Sybil simulation (25% malicious nodes)
   - Eclipse Attack (blocking connections of 15% of nodes)
   - Targeted DDoS (20% bandwidth)

4. **Evaluation Process**:
   - Each benchmark runs for 24 hours
   - Data collection every 5 minutes
   - 3 repetitions for each platform
   - Statistical analysis with 95% confidence interval

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## 📈 Caching Efficiency

QTrust uses intelligent caching strategies to optimize performance:

  <p><em>Figure 2: QTrust's cache performance compared to traditional methods (LRU, LFU) and modern solutions</em></p>
</div>

> **💡 Caching Efficiency Evaluation**: Data collected from real-world tests with 10 million custom queries, using Pareto-Zipf distribution as the access model. QTrust's intelligent caching method combines context-awareness with reinforcement learning (RL) to predict access patterns and optimize cache memory.

## 💻 Federated Learning

QTrust uses federated learning to train distributed models with privacy protection:

  <p><em>Figure 4: Comparison of privacy protection capabilities and impact on performance</em></p>
</div>

> **🔍 Federated Learning Evaluation Method**: The study was conducted with data distributed across 100 nodes, each containing an average of 2,500 non-IID data samples. Comparison process:
> 1. **QTrust FL**: Proprietary solution using multi-level privacy protection
> 2. **Centralized**: Traditional centralized training (baseline)
> 3. **Standard FL**: Federated Averaging without advanced privacy protection measures
> 4. **Local Only**: Local training only, no aggregation

</div>

> **⚙️ Performance Evaluation Details**: Data collected in a test environment with transaction load gradually increasing from 100 to 10,000 tx/second. Methods tested under the same network conditions and hardware configuration. Communication cost measured as total bandwidth used (MB) per node during synchronization and consensus.
