# System Architecture

## 3.1 Architectural Overview

QTrust is designed as a comprehensive blockchain framework that addresses the blockchain trilemma through an intelligent sharding approach powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Federated Learning. Figure 1 presents the high-level architecture of QTrust, illustrating the key components and their interactions.

The QTrust architecture follows a modular design that enables flexible deployment, efficient scaling, and robust fault tolerance. At its core, QTrust consists of six primary components: (1) the Blockchain Environment, (2) Rainbow DQN Agents, (3) the Hierarchical Trust-based Data Center Mechanism (HTDCM), (4) the Adaptive Consensus module, (5) the MAD-RAPID router, and (6) the Federated Learning system. These components work together to create a dynamic, self-optimizing blockchain platform that continuously adapts to changing network conditions, transaction patterns, and security threats.

## 3.2 Design Principles and Objectives

QTrust's architecture is guided by the following key design principles:

1. **Dynamic Adaptability**: The system should continuously adapt its configuration and behavior based on real-time network conditions, transaction patterns, and security threats.

2. **Security-Performance Balance**: Rather than treating security and performance as opposing objectives, the system should dynamically optimize for both based on the specific requirements of each transaction and the current network state.

3. **Decentralized Intelligence**: Decision-making intelligence should be distributed across the network rather than concentrated in a central authority, maintaining the decentralized nature of blockchain systems.

4. **Privacy Preservation**: The system should harness the collective intelligence of the network while preserving the privacy and sovereignty of individual nodes.

5. **Scalable Architecture**: The system design should enable horizontal scaling with minimal coordination overhead and without compromising security or performance.

6. **Fault Tolerance**: The system should maintain robust operation even in the presence of node failures, network partitions, and adversarial attacks.

These principles guide the design of QTrust's components and their interactions, ensuring that the system effectively addresses the blockchain trilemma while providing a flexible and robust foundation for decentralized applications.

## 3.3 Component Descriptions

### 3.3.1 Blockchain Environment

The Blockchain Environment serves as the foundational layer of QTrust, providing the basic infrastructure for blockchain operations with sharding capabilities. It is responsible for maintaining the blockchain state, processing transactions, and managing the shard structure. Formally, we define the Blockchain Environment as:

$BE = (S, N, T, C, G)$

Where:
- $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$ is the set of shards
- $N = \{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_m\}$ is the set of nodes
- $T = \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k\}$ is the set of transactions
- $C = \{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_p\}$ is the set of consensus protocols
- $G = (V, E)$ is the network graph where $V \subseteq N$ and $E$ represents connections

Each shard $s_i$ contains a subset of nodes $N_i \subset N$ and maintains its own state $St_i$. Shards process transactions independently but collaborate for cross-shard transactions. The Blockchain Environment also provides an interface for the DRL agents to observe the network state and apply actions.

For dynamic resharding, the Blockchain Environment monitors shard congestion levels and performance metrics, triggering resharding operations when predefined thresholds are exceeded. This is represented as:

$Resharding(s_i, s_j) = \begin{cases}
Split(s_i), & \text{if } Congestion(s_i) > \theta_{high} \\
Merge(s_i, s_j), & \text{if } Congestion(s_i) < \theta_{low} \text{ and } Congestion(s_j) < \theta_{low} \\
NoChange, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$

Where $\theta_{high}$ and $\theta_{low}$ represent the high and low congestion thresholds respectively.

### 3.3.2 Rainbow DQN Agents

The Rainbow DQN Agents form the decision-making core of QTrust, optimizing transaction routing and shard allocation based on the observed network state. Rainbow DQN [65] combines several improvements to the basic DQN algorithm, including Double Q-learning, Prioritized Experience Replay, Dueling Networks, Multi-step learning, Distributional RL, and Noisy Nets.

In QTrust, we define the RL problem as follows:

- **State** ($s_t$): The current state of the blockchain network, including shard congestion levels, average transaction values, node trust scores, and recent success rates.
- **Action** ($a_t$): A decision tuple $(d, c)$ where $d$ represents the destination shard for a transaction and $c$ represents the selected consensus protocol.
- **Reward** ($r_t$): A composite function of throughput, latency, energy consumption, and security:

$r_t = \alpha \cdot r_{throughput} - \beta \cdot r_{latency} - \gamma \cdot r_{energy} + \delta \cdot r_{security}$

Where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ are weight coefficients that balance the different objectives.

The Rainbow DQN agent learns a policy $\pi$ that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward:

$Q^*(s, a) = \mathbb{E}\left[ r_t + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s_{t+1}, a') \right]$

To handle the dynamic nature of blockchain environments, we implement a non-stationary adaptation technique that adjusts the learning rate based on the detected level of environment non-stationarity.

### 3.3.3 Hierarchical Trust-based Data Center Mechanism (HTDCM)

The HTDCM provides a multi-level trust evaluation framework that combines transaction history, response times, peer ratings, and machine learning-based anomaly detection to maintain accurate and nuanced trust scores for all nodes in the network. Formally:

$HTDCM = (NT, ST, AD, PS)$

Where:
- $NT = \{nt_1, nt_2, \ldots, nt_m\}$ is the set of node trust scores
- $ST = \{st_1, st_2, \ldots, st_n\}$ is the set of shard trust scores
- $AD$ is the anomaly detection system
- $PS$ is the pattern spotting mechanism

For each node $i$, the trust score is calculated as:

$nt_i = w_{ts} \cdot ts_i + w_{rt} \cdot rt_i + w_{pr} \cdot pr_i - w_{ma} \cdot ma_i$

Where:
- $ts_i$ is the transaction success rate
- $rt_i$ is the normalized response time (higher is better)
- $pr_i$ is the average peer rating
- $ma_i$ is the malicious activity count
- $w_{ts}$, $w_{rt}$, $w_{pr}$, and $w_{ma}$ are weight coefficients

Shard trust scores are aggregated from node trust scores:

$st_j = \frac{1}{|N_j|} \sum_{i \in N_j} nt_i$

The anomaly detection system uses unsupervised learning techniques to identify unusual patterns in node behavior that may indicate malicious activity. The pattern spotting mechanism identifies temporal patterns in node behavior that may indicate coordinated attacks.

### 3.3.4 Adaptive Consensus

The Adaptive Consensus module dynamically selects the optimal consensus protocol for each transaction based on its value, the current network conditions, and the trust profile of participating nodes. Formally:

$AC = (CP, PS, PM)$

Where:
- $CP = \{FastBFT, PBFT, RobustBFT, LightBFT\}$ is the set of consensus protocols
- $PS$ is the protocol selection function
- $PM$ is the performance monitoring system

The protocol selection function maps transaction and network parameters to a specific consensus protocol:

$PS(tv, c, ts, ns) \mapsto cp \in CP$

Where:
- $tv$ is the transaction value
- $c$ is the current congestion level
- $ts$ is the trust score of the shard
- $ns$ is the network stability

Each consensus protocol is characterized by its latency factor ($lf$), energy factor ($ef$), and security factor ($sf$):

$FastBFT: (lf=0.2, ef=0.3, sf=0.7)$
$PBFT: (lf=0.5, ef=0.6, sf=0.85)$
$RobustBFT: (lf=0.8, ef=0.8, sf=0.95)$
$LightBFT: (lf=0.15, ef=0.2, sf=0.75)$

The performance monitoring system continuously evaluates the performance of each consensus protocol and updates their characteristics based on observed performance metrics.

### 3.3.5 MAD-RAPID Router

The MAD-RAPID (Multi-Agent Dynamic Routing and Adaptive Path Intelligence Distribution) system optimizes cross-shard transaction routing to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Formally:

$MAD\text{-}RAPID = (SG, CP, DM, TH)$

Where:
- $SG$ is the shard graph representing the logical topology of shards
- $CP$ is the congestion prediction module
- $DM$ is the dynamic mesh connection manager
- $TH$ is the transaction history analyzer

For a transaction $t$ originating from shard $s_i$ with destination shard $s_j$, the optimal path is determined by:

$Path(t, s_i, s_j) = \arg\min_{p \in Paths(s_i, s_j)} Cost(p, t)$

Where $Paths(s_i, s_j)$ is the set of all possible paths from $s_i$ to $s_j$, and $Cost(p, t)$ is a weighted function of path length, congestion, and security:

$Cost(p, t) = w_l \cdot Length(p) + w_c \cdot Congestion(p) + w_s \cdot (1 - Security(p))$

The congestion prediction module uses time-series analysis and machine learning to predict future congestion levels based on historical patterns:

$Congestion_{t+\delta}(s_i) = f(Congestion_{t-n:t}(s_i), Traffic_{t-n:t})$

The dynamic mesh connection manager establishes direct connections between shards with high transaction volumes to reduce routing overhead:

$MeshConnection(s_i, s_j) = \begin{cases}
Establish, & \text{if } Traffic(s_i, s_j) > \theta_{traffic} \\
Remove, & \text{if } Traffic(s_i, s_j) < \theta_{traffic} \cdot \alpha \\
NoChange, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$

Where $\theta_{traffic}$ is the traffic threshold and $\alpha$ is a hysteresis factor.

### 3.3.6 Federated Learning System

The Federated Learning system enables privacy-preserving distributed model training across the network. Formally:

$FL = (LM, AGG, DP, CM)$

Where:
- $LM = \{lm_1, lm_2, \ldots, lm_m\}$ is the set of local models
- $AGG$ is the aggregation function
- $DP$ is the differential privacy mechanism
- $CM$ is the communication manager

For each round of federated learning, nodes train local models on their private data:

$lm_i^{t+1} = lm_i^t - \eta \nabla L(lm_i^t, D_i)$

Where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $\nabla L$ is the gradient of the loss function, and $D_i$ is the local dataset.

The aggregation function combines local models into a global model:

$gm^{t+1} = AGG(lm_1^{t+1}, lm_2^{t+1}, \ldots, lm_k^{t+1})$

We use a weighted FedAvg [72] algorithm for aggregation, with weights proportional to the amount of training data and node trust scores:

$gm^{t+1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k |D_i| \cdot nt_i \cdot lm_i^{t+1}}{\sum_{i=1}^k |D_i| \cdot nt_i}$

The differential privacy mechanism adds calibrated noise to model updates to prevent the extraction of private information:

$\widetilde{lm}_i^{t+1} = lm_i^{t+1} + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$

The communication manager optimizes the exchange of model updates to minimize communication overhead while maintaining model quality.

## 3.4 Component Interactions and Data Flow

The components of QTrust interact through well-defined interfaces to create a cohesive system. Figure 2 illustrates the data flow between components.

1. The Blockchain Environment provides state observations to the Rainbow DQN Agents, the HTDCM, and the MAD-RAPID Router.
2. The Rainbow DQN Agents decide on transaction routing and consensus protocol selection based on the observed state.
3. The HTDCM evaluates node and shard trust scores, which influence the decisions of the Rainbow DQN Agents and the Adaptive Consensus module.
4. The Adaptive Consensus module selects the appropriate consensus protocol based on transaction characteristics and network conditions.
5. The MAD-RAPID Router optimizes cross-shard transaction paths based on congestion predictions and trust evaluations.
6. The Federated Learning system trains and updates models across the network, improving the decision-making capabilities of all components.

This interaction pattern creates a feedback loop where each component's decisions influence the network state, which in turn affects future decisions. This dynamic adaptation enables QTrust to continuously optimize for security, performance, and decentralization based on real-time conditions.

## 3.5 Scalability and Fault Tolerance

QTrust's architecture is designed for horizontal scalability through its sharding approach and modular component design. As the network grows, additional shards can be created to maintain consistent performance. The key to QTrust's scalability is the minimization of cross-shard coordination through intelligent transaction routing and predictive congestion management.

Fault tolerance is achieved through several mechanisms:

1. **Replication**: Each shard maintains multiple copies of its state across nodes, ensuring continuity even if some nodes fail.
2. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: The consensus protocols used within and across shards are designed to tolerate Byzantine failures, ensuring correct operation even in the presence of malicious nodes.
3. **Graceful Degradation**: If a shard becomes unavailable or compromised, the system can dynamically reassign its responsibilities to other shards.
4. **Adaptive Trust Management**: The HTDCM continuously evaluates node and shard trust, allowing the system to identify and isolate faulty or malicious components before they can cause significant damage.

## 3.6 Addressing the Blockchain Trilemma

QTrust's architecture directly addresses the blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization through its integrated approach:

**Scalability** is achieved through intelligent sharding, where transactions are processed in parallel across multiple shards. The MAD-RAPID Router optimizes cross-shard transactions to minimize coordination overhead, while the Adaptive Consensus module selects lightweight consensus protocols for low-value transactions to maximize throughput.

**Security** is maintained through the HTDCM's sophisticated trust evaluation system, which identifies and isolates malicious nodes. The Adaptive Consensus module selects appropriate consensus protocols based on transaction value and risk, ensuring that high-value transactions receive maximum security guarantees. Additionally, the Rainbow DQN Agents continuously adapt routing decisions to avoid vulnerable network configurations.

**Decentralization** is preserved through the federated learning approach, which distributes intelligence across the network without requiring centralized control. The system's decision-making processes are transparent and based on objective metrics, preventing the concentration of power in any single entity.

By dynamically optimizing these three aspects based on real-time conditions, QTrust achieves a balance that traditional static systems cannot match. The result is a blockchain system that adapts to the specific requirements of each transaction and the current network state, providing optimal performance without compromising security or decentralization.
