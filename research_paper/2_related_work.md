In this section, we review the existing literature related to blockchain sharding, trust mechanisms, reinforcement learning and federated learning applications in distributed systems, with a focus on approaches that address the scalability-security-decentralization trilemma.

## 2.1 Blockchain Sharding Techniques

Sharding has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to blockchain scalability. Inspired by traditional database partitioning techniques, sharding divides the blockchain network into smaller subnetworks (shards) that process transactions in parallel, thereby significantly increasing throughput [35,36].

Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain implements a beacon-guided sharding approach where a central chain coordinates multiple shard chains [37]. While this design improves scalability, Buterin et al. [38] acknowledge that cross-shard communication remains a significant challenge, with latency increasing proportionally to the number of shards involved in a transaction. Similarly, Polkadot's multi-chain architecture uses a relay chain to coordinate parachains [39], but Wang et al. [40] demonstrated that its throughput degrades significantly under high cross-chain transaction loads.

Harmony [41] introduced an innovative sharding approach based on Distributed Randomness Generation (DRG) for validator assignment. However, as noted by Li et al. [42], this approach struggles with dynamic network conditions and does not adapt validator assignments based on real-time performance metrics. Zilliqa [43] pioneered the use of computational sharding but limited it to transaction validation rather than state sharding, which restricts its scalability benefits.

Elrond [44] and Near Protocol [45] both implemented adaptive state sharding with varying degrees of success. Elrond's Adaptive State Sharding combines network, transaction, and state sharding but uses a relatively simple heuristic-based approach for shard reconfiguration that lacks the sophistication needed for highly dynamic networks [46]. Kokoris-Kogias et al. [47] proposed OmniLedger, which uses a Byzantine consensus protocol within each shard but requires a complex atomic commit protocol for cross-shard transactions that introduces significant overhead.

A common limitation across these systems is their reliance on predetermined or simplistic adaptive mechanisms that fail to fully optimize for the complex interplay between security, performance, and decentralization in dynamic network environments [48,49]. Furthermore, as noted by Yang et al. [50], existing sharding approaches have not effectively leveraged recent advances in machine learning for dynamic optimization.

## 2.2 Trust and Reputation Mechanisms in Blockchain

Trust and reputation mechanisms play a crucial role in blockchain security, particularly in sharded environments where malicious nodes could potentially compromise individual shards. Early work by Kamvar et al. [51] on EigenTrust provided foundational approaches to distributed trust calculation, but their method lacks the sophistication needed for adversarial blockchain environments.

PeerTrust, proposed by Xiong and Liu [52], introduced context-aware trust metrics but did not address temporal attack patterns common in blockchain networks. More recently, Dennis and Owen [53] developed a reputation-based framework specifically for blockchain systems, but their approach relies on simplistic binary trust calculations that fail to capture the nuanced behavior of nodes.

In the context of sharded blockchains, Feng et al. [54] proposed a multi-dimensional trust model that considers transaction history and stake, but their approach does not incorporate machine learning for anomaly detection. Similarly, RapidChain [55] implements a trust-based shard reconfiguration mechanism, but it operates on fixed intervals rather than adapting to dynamic network conditions.

The emergence of sophisticated attack vectors such as Sybil attacks, eclipse attacks, and long-range attacks has highlighted the limitations of existing trust mechanisms [56,57]. As demonstrated by Heilman et al. [58], even well-established blockchain networks can be vulnerable to targeted attacks when trust assessments are not sufficiently sophisticated.

A significant gap in current approaches is the lack of hierarchical trust evaluation that incorporates both micro-level (node) and macro-level (shard) assessments, as well as the absence of machine learning techniques to detect anomalous behavior patterns that may indicate coordinated attacks [59,60].

## 2.3 Reinforcement Learning in Blockchain Systems

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in optimizing various aspects of blockchain systems. Salimitari et al. [61] applied Q-learning to improve consensus efficiency, while Liu et al. [62] used Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to optimize mining strategies. However, these approaches focused on narrow optimization problems rather than holistic system performance.

More relevant to our work, Zhang et al. [63] proposed an RL-based approach for transaction allocation in sharded blockchains. Their method showed improvements in throughput but did not address cross-shard transaction optimization or adaptive consensus selection. Similarly, Wang et al. [64] developed a reinforcement learning framework for dynamic sharding but focused primarily on shard composition rather than the broader ecosystem of transaction routing and consensus selection.

The application of advanced RL techniques such as Rainbow DQN [65] to blockchain systems remains largely unexplored. While Rainbow DQN has demonstrated superior performance in complex environments by combining multiple DQN improvements, its potential for blockchain optimization has not been fully realized. Fan et al. [66] explored the use of Double DQN for blockchain parameter tuning but did not implement the full suite of Rainbow enhancements.

A key limitation of existing RL applications in blockchain is their reliance on simplified simulation environments that fail to capture the complexity of real-world blockchain networks [67,68]. Additionally, most approaches have focused on single-agent RL rather than multi-agent systems that better reflect the decentralized nature of blockchain networks [69].

## 2.4 Federated Learning in Distributed Systems

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed networks while preserving data privacy [70,71]. The seminal work by McMahan et al. [72] on Federated Averaging (FedAvg) demonstrated that models could be trained effectively without centralizing sensitive data, making FL particularly relevant for blockchain applications.

In the blockchain context, Kim et al. [73] proposed BlockFL, which uses blockchain for secure aggregation of model updates in federated learning. However, their approach did not address the unique challenges of sharded blockchain environments. Mugunthan et al. [74] extended this work with SplitNN, which integrates vertical federated learning with blockchain validation, but their system was not designed for dynamic sharding environments.

Che et al. [75] explored the use of federated learning for consensus optimization but did not address the broader ecosystem of sharding, routing, and trust evaluation. Similarly, Lu et al. [76] investigated privacy-preserving federated learning for blockchain applications but focused primarily on the privacy aspects rather than performance optimization.

A significant limitation of existing approaches is their failure to fully leverage the synergies between federated learning and reinforcement learning in blockchain environments [77,78]. Additionally, current implementations have not adequately addressed the challenges of non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data in blockchain networks, where different shards may have vastly different transaction patterns [79].

## 2.5 Cross-Shard Transaction Protocols

Cross-shard transactions represent a critical bottleneck in sharded blockchain systems. Zamani et al. [80] proposed RapidChain, which uses an atomic commit protocol for cross-shard transactions, but their approach still requires coordination between multiple shards, introducing latency. Similarly, Chainspace [81] implements a Byzantine fault-tolerant atomic commit protocol (S-BAC) for cross-shard transactions, but it suffers from coordination overhead as the number of shards increases.

More recent approaches have attempted to optimize cross-shard transactions through parallel processing. Amiri et al. [82] proposed Sharper, which uses dependency graphs to maximize parallel execution of cross-shard transactions. However, their approach does not account for dynamic network conditions and trust evaluations in routing decisions.

AHL et al. [83] introduced a verification protocol for cross-shard transactions that reduces coordination requirements but still incurs significant communication overhead. Dang et al. [84] proposed a timestamp-based protocol for cross-shard transactions that improves throughput but does not adapt to changing network conditions.

A common limitation across these approaches is their failure to leverage machine learning techniques for predictive routing and congestion avoidance [85,86]. Additionally, existing protocols typically treat all cross-shard transactions equally, without considering transaction characteristics or network conditions in their routing decisions [87].

## 2.6 Attack Detection and Prevention in Sharded Blockchains

Security in sharded blockchains presents unique challenges, as attackers need only compromise a single shard to potentially disrupt the entire system. Avarikioti et al. [88] analyzed the security implications of sharding and proposed a threshold-based mechanism for detecting shard takeovers, but their approach relies on predetermined thresholds that may not adapt to evolving attack patterns.

Coordinated attacks, such as Sybil attacks and eclipse attacks, present particularly severe threats to sharded blockchains. Natoli et al. [89] demonstrated the vulnerability of cross-shard consensus to eclipse attacks, while Bissias et al. [90] showed how an attacker could exploit cross-shard transaction protocols to execute double-spending attacks with relatively few resources.

Machine learning approaches for attack detection in blockchain systems have shown promise. Meng et al. [91] used supervised learning to detect anomalous transactions in Bitcoin, while Chen et al. [92] employed unsupervised learning for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. However, these approaches have not been extensively applied to the specific security challenges of sharded blockchains.

A significant limitation of existing attack detection mechanisms is their reactive nature—they typically identify attacks after they have begun rather than predicting and preventing them proactively [93,94]. Additionally, current approaches often operate in isolation, without leveraging the collective intelligence of the entire network through techniques such as federated learning [95].

## 2.7 Differentiation from Existing Approaches

QTrust differs from existing approaches in several key aspects:

1. **Integrated Learning Framework**: Unlike previous works that apply machine learning techniques to isolated aspects of blockchain systems, QTrust provides an integrated framework that combines Rainbow DQN for dynamic optimization with federated learning for privacy-preserving distributed intelligence.

2. **Hierarchical Trust Evaluation**: QTrust's HTDCM goes beyond simple reputation systems by implementing a multi-level trust evaluation framework that combines transaction history, response times, peer ratings, and machine learning-based anomaly detection.

3. **Adaptive Consensus Selection**: While existing systems typically employ a single consensus protocol across all shards, QTrust dynamically selects the optimal consensus protocol for each transaction based on its characteristics and network conditions.

4. **Predictive Cross-Shard Routing**: Unlike reactive routing protocols in existing systems, QTrust's MAD-RAPID system employs predictive algorithms that anticipate congestion and dynamically adjust routing strategies to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

5. **Privacy-Preserving Collective Intelligence**: QTrust leverages federated learning to harness the collective intelligence of the network while preserving the privacy and sovereignty of individual nodes, addressing a critical limitation of existing centralized learning approaches.

6. **Comprehensive Security Framework**: Rather than addressing individual attack vectors in isolation, QTrust implements a holistic security framework that combines preventive measures, real-time detection, and adaptive response mechanisms.

7. **Performance-Security Balance**: Unlike many existing systems that prioritize either performance or security, QTrust continuously optimizes for both through dynamic adaptation of its components based on real-time conditions.

In summary, while existing approaches have made significant contributions to individual aspects of blockchain sharding, QTrust represents the first comprehensive framework that integrates advanced machine learning techniques to address the full spectrum of challenges in sharded blockchain systems. By dynamically optimizing for security, performance, and decentralization based on real-time conditions, QTrust offers a substantial advancement over static or simplistically adaptive approaches in the current literature.
